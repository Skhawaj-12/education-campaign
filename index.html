                <p>My name is <strong>Sana</strong>, and I'm a computer science student from Amman, Jordan. For as long as I can remember, technology has fascinated me—not just the code or the algorithms, but the incredible power it has to solve real problems and help people.</p>
                
                <p>I've spent years working toward my degree, pushing through every obstacle that came my way. There were nights I stayed up late studying after long days, moments when I questioned if I could keep going, and times when the financial pressure felt overwhelming. But I never gave up, because this dream means everything to me.</p>
                
                <p>Now, I've reached a point I never thought I'd face: <strong>I can't afford to pay my university tuition anymore</strong>. I've tried everything—freelancing between classes, applying for every scholarship I could find, reaching out to everyone who might be able to help. But I've run out of options.</p>
                
                <p>This campaign isn't just about money. It's about hope. It's my last chance to stay in school and finish what I've worked so hard to build. Every contribution, no matter how small, tells me that my dreams are worth believing in—and that means more to me than I can put into words.</p>
